# A Target Group acts as a logical grouping for targets (like ECS tasks, EC2 instances, IP addresses, or Lambda functions) that are serving 
# the same content. When the ALB receives a request on one of its listeners (as defined in the previous explanation), it will forward 
# that request to a healthy target within this target group based on load balancing algorithms.
#
# In the context of an ECS cluster, when you define an ECS service, you link it to an ALB target group. The ECS service automatically 
# registers and deregisters its tasks (containers) with this target group as they start, stop, or scale, ensuring that the ALB always has 
# a list of healthy, available application instances to send traffic to.

  # pattern. If any of these variables change, a new target group with a different name will be created. This can be beneficial for blue/green 
  # deployments or when you need to ensure a new target group is deployed when certain application parameters change.
